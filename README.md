## Tagline
Random generator, Email notification

## Behind the scenes (include and describe flowchart)
- User wants to find the gift idea based on the preference (They can type either chocolate, smartwatch, or something else)
- The system will generate randomly all of the possible gifts related to that specific item, including the link where to buy it.
- At the same time, there will be two buttons at the end, either sender wants to send the surprise email to the receiver or not. They can choose to send it as anonymous or send it with their name included. 
- If the sender chooses to send the gift notification to the receiver's email, the receiver will get email notification that there will be a gift coming up soon but the email won't tell receiver what kinds of gifts the sender would like to send.


## The technologies
- Random generator API based on preference (Still finding the best API for this)
- Courier API to send the email notification

## Front-end language
- Node js
